Make open data sharing a no-brainer for ethics committees.

# Statement of the problem

The ideology of open and reproducible science make their ways into
various fields of science.  In many disciplines scientific research is
heavily data driven and thus requires unrestricted exchange/sharing of
data to attain the load goals of the open science.  In neuroimaging,
as in other fields of human-subjects research such as bio-informatics,
making imaging data publicly available requires staying within
established legal norms, i.e. addressing the aspect of subjects
privacy.  Those norms are usually established by institutional review
boards (IRB, or otherwise called ethics committees), which are in turn
"governed" by the federal regulations, such as
[45 Code of Federal Regulations Part 46] [1] in US.

Flexibility in interpretation of original regulations established in
the past century, decentralization of those committees, and lack of a
"community" influence over them created the problem: *for neuroimaging
studies there is no commonly accepted version of a Consent form
template which would allow for collected imaging data to be shared as
openly as possible while providing adequate guarantees for subjects'
privacy*.  In majority of the cases, used Consent forms simply do not
include **any** provision for public sharing of the data to get a
"speedy" IRB approval for a study.

Situation is particularly *tricky* because major granting agencies
(e.g. NIH, NSF) demand data sharing, but do not explicitly 

# Overall approach

Initially we would like to concentrate on the problem as pertinent to
neuroimaging (and associated behavioral) data. But if reaches enough
traction -- it would be great to cover any kind of scientific data
which has similar concerns.

## Goal minimum

To address this problem we decided to collect consent forms which have
been previously approved by ethic committees in different
institutions.  Such samples could serve a basis for introducing
similar *ad-hoc* consent forms at other institutions so they fulfill
the desires of any particular committee, while allowing public sharing
of collected data.

## Ultimate goal

Analysis of those might allow us to distill an *ultimate* form (or a
set of those for different use-cases and jurisdictions, and/or
guidelines) which would be compliant with all regulatory statues,
while allowing for open sharing and access to the neuroimaging data.

If regulated by the federal/state law, there is really no objective
reason why there could be no consensus among IRB committees within the
same jurisdictions. Although somewhat a utopian statement, we hope
that with examples/precedent cases and possibly **your** enthusiastic
involvement we cold achieve our goal.

## Side goals

Data must be de-identified before distribution.  We will collect
information on existing and possibly establishing new pipelines to
standardize annonimization of neuroimaging data to simplify sharing.

# PARTICIPATE

## Researchers

### Survey

Please first fill out the VERY brief survey about the consent forms
for your studies: http://goo.gl/forms/2lsmYcOsAs . It has only few
questions and should take only a few minutes to fill out.  Even if
your Consent form doesn't include yet any provision for data sharing
-- your contribution would be very valuable, although would consist of
simply saying "No".

### Additional materials

Please file an [issue][2] or even send a new [pull request] [3] with

- samples of consent forms allowing re-distribution/deposit to
  public archives

- relevant publications and discussions

- changes/recommendations for the **ultimate** consent form formulation

## IRB committee members

We would welcome your feedback  very much, in particular

- what concerns on public sharing of neuroimaging data you might have
  if any identifiable information removed (e.g. skull stripped) and
  subjects agreed to those terms?

- what particular consent form composition and wording aspects would
  you recommend? (e.g. "make it an explicit additional form requiring
  a separate signature") and why?
