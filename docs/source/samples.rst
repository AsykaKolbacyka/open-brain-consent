Sample consent forms
====================

`samples/` directory of our `git repository`_ contains samples of the
consent forms found online.  Because there is no explicit permission
allowing their re-distribution we are not including them in this
repository/site, but rather link to them as they are available on the
web.  Our `git repository`_ is also a `git annex`_ repository so you
should be to `git annex get` any file of interest, if it is still
available online.

.. _git annex: http://git-annex.branchable.com

And here you can find a list of those files contained under `samples/`:
